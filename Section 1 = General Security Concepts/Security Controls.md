## Introduction
In IT security, attackers continuously seek ways to exploit vulnerabilities. Security professionals must implement **security controls** to:
- **Prevent** breaches.
- **Minimize impact** of attacks.
- **Mitigate damage** after an incident.

### Categories of Security Controls
1. **Technical Controls** – Implemented via technology (e.g., firewalls, antivirus).
2. **Managerial Controls** – Policies and procedures defining security practices.
3. **Operational Controls** – Human-based security measures (e.g., security guards, training).
4. **Physical Controls** – Restricting physical access (e.g., fences, badge readers).

## Types of Security Controls

### 1. **Preventive Controls** (Stops Attacks Before They Happen)
- **Purpose:** Prevent security incidents by restricting access before an attack occurs.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** Firewall rules blocking unauthorized network traffic.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Onboarding security policies restricting system access.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Security guard verifying IDs at entrance.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** Door locks preventing unauthorized entry.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A company implements a **firewall** blocking traffic from unknown IPs. Meanwhile, security **guards verify employee IDs** before allowing them inside.

---

### 2. **Deterrent Controls** (Discourages Malicious Activity)
- **Purpose:** Discourage attackers or unauthorized users from attempting breaches.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** Security warning splash screens.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Policies enforcing penalties for accessing restricted data.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Receptionist verifying visitors.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** "Area Under Surveillance" warning signs.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A **bank** places CCTV warning signs to discourage break-ins, while employees receive a **security policy reminder** upon login.

---

### 3. **Detective Controls** (Identifies Security Breaches)
- **Purpose:** Detect incidents and alert administrators when security events occur.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** System logs tracking suspicious activity.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Regular login reports review.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Security patrols monitoring restricted areas.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** Motion detectors triggering alerts.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A **company uses SIEM** to detect unauthorized login attempts, while a **motion sensor** alerts security when movement is detected after hours.

---

### 4. **Corrective Controls** (Responds to Security Incidents)
- **Purpose:** Minimize damage and restore systems after an incident occurs.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** Restoring data from backups after ransomware attack.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Incident response policies for handling breaches.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Calling law enforcement for unauthorized access.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** Using fire extinguishers to prevent spread of fire.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A **hospital hit by ransomware** restores patient records from **backups**, while security calls **law enforcement** for intruders.

---

### 5. **Compensating Controls** (Temporary Fixes Until a Permanent Solution)
- **Purpose:** Provides alternative security measures when ideal solutions aren’t available.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** Firewall rules blocking access to unpatched vulnerabilities.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Separation of duties preventing excessive access.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Multiple security guards covering sensitive areas.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** Backup power generators keeping operations running.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A software vendor **delays a security patch**, so administrators **block access** to the vulnerable system via a **firewall rule**.

---

### 6. **Directive Controls** (Guides Behavior Toward Secure Practices)
- **Purpose:** Establishes guidelines for security best practices.
- **Examples:**
  - 🔹 **Technical:** Mandatory file encryption policies.
  - 🔹 **Managerial:** Compliance policies enforcing regulations.
  - 🔹 **Operational:** Security awareness training for employees.
  - 🔹 **Physical:** "Authorized Personnel Only" signs on restricted doors.

#### 🏢 *Real-World Scenario:*
A **government agency mandates encryption**, while employees undergo **security awareness training** on best practices.

## Summary of Security Control Types

| **Control Type**   | **Purpose** | **Examples** |
|--------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Preventive** | Stops attacks before they happen | Firewalls, door locks, security policies |
| **Deterrent** | Discourages malicious activity | Security warning screens, surveillance signs |
| **Detective** | Identifies and alerts about security incidents | System logs, motion detectors, patrols |
| **Corrective** | Fixes damage after an attack | Backup restoration, law enforcement calls |
| **Compensating** | Provides a temporary security measure | Firewall rules for unpatched vulnerabilities |
| **Directive** | Guides users to follow security best practices | Compliance policies, security training |

---

## Final Thoughts
- Security controls **vary by organization** and **evolve with technology**.
- Understanding **which control type fits into which category** is key for securing IT environments.
- Security best practices **combine multiple control types** for layered protection.
